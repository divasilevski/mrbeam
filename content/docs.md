## What is a Beam?

A beam, in Structural Engineering terms, is a member that can be comprised of a number of materials (including steel and wood aluminum) to withstand loads – typically applied laterally to the beam axis. Beams can also be referred to as members, elements, rafters, shafts, or purlins.

## Calculating Shear Force Diagrams

In this tutorial, we will look at calculating the shear force diagram of a simple beam. This is an important concept to understand, as shear force is something a beam will need to be checked for, for a safe design.
